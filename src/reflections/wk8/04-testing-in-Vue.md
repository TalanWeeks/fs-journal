# Testing in Vue

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

* Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-To-End (E2E) Testing

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

* End to end tests seem to be the most important in my opinion. End-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications. This alone should make them the most important tests to run.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

* Unit testing seems the least useful in my opinion because if you are component testing then you are simply testing multiple units at the same time. Writing out a chunk of code and then testing the componenet makes more sense than testing every little thing as you write it.
