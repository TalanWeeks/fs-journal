# Portfolio building as a dev

## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

* A portfolio serves as a way for a developer to stand out and show off the projects he/her is proud of. Portfolios can make an individual stand out greatly in compared to others who don't have.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

* An effective portfolio should stand out from the others. It shouldn't be too big or complex, but it should show the depth of your skills and the skills you would like the company/ customer know you have.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

* You should only put the projects you care about and the ones that are well written. You wouldn't want to show off terrible code that would just make you look bad. You also wouldn't want to put super simple apps on the portfolio as well.
