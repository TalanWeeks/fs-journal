# Scrum for small groups

## Why is communication on a small team important?

* Communication is the key for a small teams success or any team size for that matter. If you don't have communication things can go astray very fast.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

* Everyone in the small team needs cross communication and to be on the same page about the entire app. This is less needed in bigger projects because teams are broken down into small versions of this anyways.

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

* The unattainable triangle is a reference to something that symbolizes how you cannot attain a "perfect" dynamic of speed and quality. The three sides of the triangle are: Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, and Fast service Cheap won't be Good.
