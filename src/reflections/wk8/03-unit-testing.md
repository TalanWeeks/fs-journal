# Unit Testing

## What is Software Development Testing?

* The act of testing super small sections of code in order to know that sections of your code already work and shouldn't need as much testing in the end.

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

* To make sure my code works without installing the app, logging in and setting up the same conditions over and over again just to reach a certain screen and test a certain condition.

## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

* It can take a ton of time to test the app properly. This could potentially cause issues if this time was not propperly slotted out in the begginging of the sprint.
