# MISTAKES MADE AS JV

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

* Making a plan is invaluable. It can make a huge difference in the timing of  this in the long run. This checkpoint I spend a lot more time lining out what I was trying to achieve and what i was going to do in order to complete the goals. It paid off a ton in the overall time spent on the project and the outcome.

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

* When I'm stuck I try to break the problem down to the simplest components. This is usually me looking up a specific array method or how to execute a small objective i can't figure out. I've found looking for problems broadly on the internet can lead you down rabit holes that lead to nothing or a different problem entirely.

## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

* My biggest takeaways are that I do have some decent coding habits as is, which is great, but I really need to work on code optimization and encapsulation. I tend to reuse a ton of things and my code is probably way longer than it needs to be. 

* partner programming
