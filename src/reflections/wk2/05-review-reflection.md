# REFLECTIONS

## It has been a wild week

* Java was 10x harder than i thought it would be, but I do feel like I picked it up decently. I'm trash at array methods though and really need to work on them. My css and html is getting pretty solid though. I feel like I can bang out the skeleton of a web page fairly easy now. Slowly feeling like a real developer.
