## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

*  console.log is how you right to the console. It is important to use console.log for testing code and to see if values are changing correctly. You can put string number and variables into the console.log() Adding strings to the variable that is going to be printed to can help when having multiple things console.logged.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

*   The source tab allows you to see the code files of pages or websites. This is helpful when trying to hunt down where a section of a page is or what there parent div is.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

*  You can add "debugger" to you code. This will stop the code at whatever line you have written it on. This is great to watching the math break down inside of a function or for seeing if your conditionals are working correctly or not.
