# CSS into to rules/classes

## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

* a pseudo class is used to set a rule or style of a class at a certain state. ie: hover, link, active. I've already used hover a lot throughout the pre-work in order to add style to buttons on web pages. Active and link im sure i will use much more in the near future but im sure ill use hover, active, and first-child/last-child a ton throughout my coding career.

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

* specificity is used to tell the computer which rule to apply to something if there are multiple rules currently being applied to one object. 
A higher specificity will mean that the rule take priority. Specificity ranges from 0-100. 100 being the most important to apply. Tag name -span = 1 place, Class- .tittle 10 place, and Id #app = 100 place. (0,0,0)

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

* !important is sketchy to use outside of testing because it becomes the highest specificity out of all the rules being applied to something. This means that even if your css is adding style to something if the in-line style of !important is on it then all of the other rules will be ignored.!important can be a great tool for testing. It can be used to forcefully apply style/ rules to a part of code.
