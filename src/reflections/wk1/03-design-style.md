# Style and design tips and tricks

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

For me personally, I think that using color properly was the biggest tip in that article. I never thought about changing the color to a slightly different variation of the background color that the element is on. After I read this, I started seeing this on a ton of websites. It looks very clean compared to a completely different color than the background. I will definitely be using this technique a lot in the near future for color of text that is over a background or for buttons as well. I liked the look of the example buttons. I also like the idea of not having any color on the buttons as well.


## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Almost all of the major companies (especially tech companies) are a great tool of reference for amazing site designs. 
https://www.apple.com/
https://www.fanuc.com/

these are two sites that are great examples of color scheme as well as being able to go mobile and back to lrg size very smoothly.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A well designed page can have a massive impact on a company. It can make the difference between being successful or not. Having a good online presence can make a company of 3 people look like a company of hundreds. It can take a start up company and make them look like they've been around for ages. A bad designed page or even a poorly designed feature can mean massive loss in company revenue. When visiting a site if it looks old or badly maintained people will be worried about the quality of the company and their own online/computer security.
