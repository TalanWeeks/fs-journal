# ES6 MODULE classes and controllers

## What problem does using exports solve?

* Using exports enables data that is secluded to its certain class or controller to be used elsewhere in your code.

## How does export differ from export default?

* Export default exports the default values of the item you're exporting. Export allows you to import certain parts of the code in the module or controller where export default exports everything.

## What is a benefit of using the Module System?

* The major benefit of using the module system is security and being able to control what users can interact with and what is completely restricted. It also allows you to set instances up to see if certain users have access to certain items or areas of code.
