# Course Review/Reflection

## This course has been a wild ride to say the least. The pase was crazy fast at first and I had to get used to the style of learning we do. I had to get used to doing things because thats the way they are and not knowing the why. Once I got used to drinking the coolaid so to speak the time went a bit faster and I struggled less knowing that it would make sense in a week from then. In all I have gained an immense amount of knowledge about software development. I do truly feel like I've been set up for success in my future and thats a great feeling. It is also nice to be close to finshing one of the hardest things I've ever done.
