# Capstone reflection

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

* In our project we have used a ton of paired programming and api calls. We ended up using 4 apis and our own local db.

## What went well so far?

* Almost all of the project has gone well so far. Our team works very well together.

## What would you do differently? Why?

* I would prefer it if one of our teammates hadn't gotten kicked out, but you cant controll everything and he did commit the cardinal sin. Still we lost a good 2 days because of it.
