# Github basics...finally

## What is a Github action and how do they work?

* The way actions work is that you create actions in your repositories by creating one or more text files. These files are called workflows.

## What benefits do Github actions provide?

* Workflows can handle common build tasks, like continuous delivery and continuous integration. You can use an action to compress images, test your code, and push the site to your hosting platform when the master branch changes.

## What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

* Workflow, Scheduled, Webhooks, and External. Workflow: push, pull, or fork type requests. Webhook: when somebody stars your repo or when a Wiki page gets created or edited. Scheduled: timed. External: an external trigger similar to webhook.
