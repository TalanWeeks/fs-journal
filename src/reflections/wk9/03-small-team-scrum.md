# Scrum in small teams

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

* Everyone in the small team needs cross communication and to be on the same page about the entire app. This is less needed in bigger projects because teams are broken down into small versions of this anyways. Essentially clear communication and making sure everyone is on the same page and the end goal is in everyones mind.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

* In scrum you shouldn't be trying to do multiple unrealted things. Scrum is about breaking a project down and tackling it one step at a time. A sprint is a time frame as well so it would be weird to talk about another sprint before one is finished.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

* The unattainable triangle is a reference to something that symbolizes how you cannot attain a "perfect" dynamic of speed and quality. It is the reality of scrum. Everything might look perfect on paper, but things are bound to happen in real life that will set you back and throw you off track.
