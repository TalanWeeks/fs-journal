# Partner Project Reflextion

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

* This whole week involved partner programming and it was a very good experience overall. We used pair programming a little but mainly at the end when there werent as much things to do. I tried to document things that were harder or that needed to be done.

## What went well?

* In general almost everything went well. We worked as a very good team and kept a solid balance the entire time. 

## What would you do differently?

* The only thing I would change is maybe have spent a couple of short nights working on it after school instead of having to bust everything out by Friday 1am.
