# Pair Programming

## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work

* Pair programming is when two programmers are working on one workspace together and using one computer between the two of them. The one coding is called the driver and the one not coding is called the navigator.

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

*  The main benifit ideally is better code all around. You are coding with two brains instead of one so this should allow you to pick up in an area where the other partner might fall short. This should give you an end result of a much more rounded application than if it was done by just one person.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

* The main draw backs with paired programming is essentailly how well you work with your partner. You guys must be on the same page together and must be willing to work in the manner of how the other works. It can be hard to get caught up in how someone is doing something compared to how you do something even if they achieve the same end result.
