# User Experience UX

## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

*  User experience is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. It's important to remember how much of an impact UX can have on the company you work for. The goal of good UX is to help users do what they want to do when interacting with your business.

## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

* The main benifits are return customers or return visitors to your site. If they enjoy using your site they are more likely going to spend more time there.

## Why is the User Experience important?

* By keeping your audience's feelings in mind, you can create strong UX that arranges all of your information and interactions in a way that's pleasing to people. And, when the UX of your site or app makes people feel good, they're more likely to stick around and become customers.
