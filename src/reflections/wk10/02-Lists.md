# Lists

## What is a List in C#?

* A list in C# is very similar to an array in JS. It is a collection of data that can be altered in many ways.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

* The most common methods I think I'll use is Add and Remove because those are the very basic methods and in return they will be the most commonly used in almost any application.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

* To retrieve something from a list you would have to call that specific list and target a specific index value.
