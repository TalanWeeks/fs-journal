# C# Data Types

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

* Value type, Reference type, and Pointer type. Value Type: is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. Reference type: a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. Pointer type: Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.


## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

* bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
