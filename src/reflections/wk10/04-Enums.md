# Enums in C#

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

* Enums are lists of strongly typed constants with members that are symbolic names, corresponding to an underlying integral type.

## How can you modify an Enum?

* You can cast data into an enum like most variables by setting it equal to the enum value you wish to change. The types must match though or it will not work.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

* We weren't even taught about enums let alone used them in our afternoon challenges..... It would have been nice to have been explained how they work or even know about them until I read the article.... wish i had two more hands...
