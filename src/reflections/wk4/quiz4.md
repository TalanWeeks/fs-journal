# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Asynchronous code is code that is out of synch with the flow of the code. Synchronous code is in sync with the flow of code. (top to bottom)
```
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is something that will watch a value or element and if that thing changes you can run a function or do something based on the page. ex- update the screen once info is changed.
```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Open/Close principle means that files should be open for extension or access but not modification.
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
They run the code and will process the data, but they send the data to another function called the callback function. They are used with async code functions to allow the program to run other lines then when the result is reached it will call another function to do something with the found result.
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
When we define a promise in JavaScript, it will be resolved when the time comes, or it will get rejected. They act very similar to callbacks and are essentially the old version of a callback function or an await function.
```

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Model View and Controller desing pattern is a pattern that everyone in the real world follows when they code. It is a universal format for coding and helps with security and encapsulation. Service is responsible for calls to the api.
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation is essential for security and organization in programming. Keeping private parts private.
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
