# Async and await in async code

##  What is the purpose of Async/Await?

* The main purpose of Aysnc and Await are timing of program and security or data/ stability of code by handling errors. It allows the computer to say download an image while it runs other lines of code then when that img is done downloading await will catch it essentially and can provide the data or run a function. It also allows you to debug much easier because to the debugger it sees the code as synchronous not asynchronous.

##  What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

* The function must have async in front of the function that await lies within otherwise the function wont understand the await command.

##  What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

* The main benefits of Aysnc and Await are timing of program and security or data/ stability of code by handling errors. It allows the computer to say download an image while it runs other lines of code then when that img is done downloading await will catch it essentially and can provide the data or run a function.
