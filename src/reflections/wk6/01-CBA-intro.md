# CBA componenet based Architecture

## What is Component based architecture?

* Think of components as a small feature that makes up a piece of the user interface. We use multiple components to allow users to see multiple different pages and pop ups based off of their choices.

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

* CBA allows for the DOM to be dynamically updated without the need of a page refresh. Components each have their own interfaces that can make calls to the server and update their interfaces. Because components are independent, one component can refresh without affecting other components or the UI as a whole. This allows for multiple functions to occur without interfearing with eachother.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

* CBA can often lead to bloated and polluted views. When using many components, there is the possibility that readability might actually become degraded.
