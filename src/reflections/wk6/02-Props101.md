# Vue Props

## What are props?

* Props are how we pass variables and other information between different components inside of your program. I works very similar to how we can pass variables into functions as arguments in JS. They have two main rules. One is that they are READ ONLY and the other is that they are passed DOWN the tree to descendents not up.

## What are props used for?
 
* Props are used to pass data or variables to other files in the same app. It is useful for using the same set of data across the app and also for keeping data secure across your application.

## Where can props be used or accessed?

* methods, computed props, and other Javascript used in your component they are mainly used inside of components though.
