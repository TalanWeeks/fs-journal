# MongoDb Virtuals

## What is a virtual property?

* Virtuals are additional fields for a given model. Their values can be set manually or automatically with defined functionality. A common virtual property is the full name of a person, composed of user's first and last name.

## When might you use a virtual property?

* Virtuals are great for posting who the user is and their picture or just taking certain info that you want presented so you can use late. We used it for our app to see who created the posts and were going to try and make it so it would show who posted the apps.

## How do you search by a virtual properties value?

* A set method will search through the original models data in oder to grab them and make them the virtual properties. You can't use queries to search through virtual properties.
