# Query parameters

## What is the purpose of a Query String?

* A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or “appending,” that information to the end of a URL. ex: ?a=22 at the end of a url would put that data to the  server.

## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

* They always start with a question mark. After the question mark comes the first set of data. You can string more data on by adding the & sign onto the url string. ex: ?a=22&b=33 you can create arrays like this : ?color=blue&color=green output: color[blue,green] you can also do objects : ?car[color]=black output= {car,{color:'black'}}

## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

*  They could be super helpful for user input being put into the server of the website.
