## What are the three types of relationships?

* 1 to 1 one thing is tied to one thing, 1 to many one thing is tied to many but for those many things  they are tied to just one, and many to many a book can be tied to many authors and an author can be tied to many books.

## What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding

* Linking is similar to how traditional relational databases would store the data using a key.

##  What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

*  When dealing with many to many relationships it is important think about how you want to handle our data if we want to 1 way embed it 2 way embed it or use linking.
